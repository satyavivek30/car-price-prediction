# **Car Price Prediction**
# **Project Overview**
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features. The model aims to provide accurate price estimates, which can be beneficial for potential buyers, sellers, and other stakeholders in the automotive industry.

# **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is quikr_car.csv, which contains various features related to car listings. These features include make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, and more.

# **Methodology**
The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Loading and Exploration: Loading the data from quikr_car.csv and performing initial exploration to understand its structure and features.
2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing features where necessary.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating and selecting relevant features to improve model performance.
4. Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms to develop the price prediction model.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics like MSE, MAE, and R-squared.
6. Prediction: Making price predictions on test data and analyzing the results.

# **Libraries Used**
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. sklearn
